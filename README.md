# Data Structures

A **data structure** is a particular way of organizing data in a computer memory so that it can be used effectively.
In other words, it is a collection of data, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.

## 1. Dynamic Array

Dynamic array is used to store dynamically sized collection of elements. 
Contrary to static arrays that are fixed in size, a dynamic array grows its size automatically when new elements are added to it.
In other words, it grows its size to accommodate new elements and shrinks the size when the elements are removed.
